It's also a weird assumption that most people would just dive into crypto after inheriting wealth. Guy needs to step out of the echo chamber for a bit,0
"Even being in crypto now, I’m probably not planning to go any deeper in crypto if I inherit any wealth. I’ll likely put it towards a mix of paying off a chunk of the mortgage, putting it in my kids’ 529 account, and investing in index funds for retirement.",0

"In 2018 Crypto.com allegedly paid $12 million for the domain, which now sees like an absolute bargain.",1
This subreddit failed to discuss Crypto.com’s $100 Million marketing push when it was announced. We have gone from news oriented to price reactionary,1
On October 28th crypto.com announced a 100 million dollar marketing push. The most I can find talking about it from this subreddit is a 300 upvote post mentioning the Matt Damon deal.,0
"This sub is an echo chamber, if it doesn't fit the ideas of the masses then it doesn't get upvoted.",0
"Yup. If you hear about it on this sub, it's already too late.",0

"Someone transferred $883,169,000 in Bitcoin and paid a fee of $0.90. That’s a transaction fee of 0.00000000019%",2
In case you were looking for a reason to be bullish on BTC,2
"My bank paid me £0.01 interest this month based on ~£2,000. 77100%+ less than Cryptocurrency would have made me if I staked the same amount in stablecoins",2
“my bank paid me £0.01 interest this month based on ~£2000. I would be 77100%+ better off had i staked that £2000,2

"The more I think about it, the more amazed I am by what Crypto.com has done and is doing.",2
The product itself is where CDC truly excels and why it will become the biggest exchange.,2
To offer a card that gives you free Spotify and Netflix is absolutely genius. In one single swoop it cuts away all other reasons needed to explain to someone what the hell crypto is about and why on earth should they be interested in it.,2
"It also puts Crypto.com in great company by association. Because ""We're the Netflix/Spotify of cryptocurrency"" is precisely the position they want to be in and are marching towards.",2
"CDC and its advertising will bring hundreds of millions of people to cryptocurrency. Add in the forced staking, another stroke of genius, and they'll have hundreds of billions of dollars in the vaults. This company will be like the whole world's crypto bank if it succeeds.",2

What are things you don't understand about crypto but too afraid to ask?,1
"I can’t seem to find exactly how BTC is updated. Like how is the process decided upon? Who gets to decide? I found some stuff related to it on GitHub, but I didn’t fully make sense to me.",1
All crypto is stored on chain. Your wallet just holds the cryptographic keys to access your on chain assets.,1
Like basically all crypto is basically a ton of tiny apartments on a chain and we just have the keys to it? That's wild.,1
f I knew anything about making a website. I'd make one that could teach everyone about crypto and blockchains but explain it as if I was talking to a 5yr old.,1
I wish more people would talk about investing in terms of percentage of their income instead of dollar amount. That’s a much better indicator of risk.,1
"Which coins used to be the ""next big thing"" but are now dead?",1
Am I just getting old or does this metaverse thing sound like the most ridiculous thing you've ever heard of?,1

"It seems like everyday, there's a media talking head laughing at cryptocurrencies by saying it's ""magic internet money"" that doesn't really exist in the real world.",0
"Compare that with crypto. If you are in control of your keys, and assuming their are not compromised, nobody can access your funds without your permission. Not the wallet devs, not the government, not the DEX. Nobody. You are in full control, and you will still be in control even if the governement of your country collapse.",2
"In that sense, I think that cryptocurrencies are actually more real then fiat money. ",2
"Decentralised networks are much more resilient then centralised authorities, and therefore are more likely to survive in the long-term.",2
"The biggest and most meaningful difference though is that in a bank, your money is protected… to some extent even from the bank’s own mistakes via FDIC. Try getting a chargeback with crypto… it’ll never happen.",0
"Crypto doesn’t offer protections like that, which is both a good and a bad thing.",1
That’s why I still believe banks—or at least Cefi hybrids—will continue to exist even in the far future regardless if crypto is the world currency or not.,0

The point of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general is allow for one's own economic prosperity and to create (at least for bitcoin) an undebasable and non-manipulatable asset. I am also willing to wager that this move from Nayib Bukele may be a factor that reduces future violence and crime in El Salvador.,2
